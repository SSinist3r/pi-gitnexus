# Changelog

## 0.6.0

**Breaking — peer dependency change.** Now requires `@mariozechner/pi-ai` and `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` ≥ 0.70, and `typebox` (unscoped, ≥ 1.x) instead of `@sinclair/typebox`. Users still on the 0.62 line of pi-ai/pi-coding-agent should stay on pi-gitnexus 0.5.x.

- **Migrated to `typebox` 1.x** — `@sinclair/typebox` (legacy 0.x line) was replaced by `typebox` (Sinclair's new 1.x package). pi-ai 0.70 re-exports `Type` from there. The only call site is `src/tools.ts`; API surface used (`Type.Object`, `Type.String`, `Type.Optional`, etc.) is unchanged.
- **Dropped `session_switch` listener** — pi-coding-agent 0.70 unified session activation under a single `session_start` event with a `reason` field (`"startup" | "reload" | "new" | "resume" | "fork"`). The previous `session_switch` event was removed; one `session_start` registration now covers both initial start and switches.
- **Routine dev-dep bumps**: `@biomejs/biome` ^2.4.8 → ^2.4.13, `@types/node` ^25.3.0 → ^25.6.0, `typescript` ^6.0.2 → ^6.0.3, `vitest` ^4.1.1 → ^4.1.5.
- Side effect: `npm audit` now reports 0 vulnerabilities (was 11). The pi-ai 0.70 transitive tree no longer pulls in the previously-flagged packages.

## 0.5.2

- **Windows compatibility — `gitnexus` binary now spawns correctly** — switched all seven `gitnexus`-invoking `child_process.spawn` call sites (binary probe, `/gitnexus status` and `/gitnexus analyze` from both the direct command and the interactive menu, `runAugment`, MCP client) to [`cross-spawn`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-spawn). On Windows, npm-installed global binaries are `.cmd` shims that the native `spawn` cannot execute directly; previously every call silently failed with the "gitnexus not on PATH" warning even when the binary was correctly installed, and `gitnexus_*` tools failed with ENOENT on every MCP call. cross-spawn resolves the binary, dispatches `.cmd`/`.bat` shims through `cmd.exe` with proper per-argument escaping, and is a no-op on macOS/Linux.
- **Defense-in-depth over `shell: true`** — `shell: process.platform === 'win32'` (the obvious one-line fix) would have routed agent-derived `augment <pattern>` args through `cmd.exe` parsing on Windows. Modern Node (≥ 18.20.2 / 20.12.2 / 21.7.3) blocks the worst metacharacters in args under `shell: true` after CVE-2024-27980, so this is hardening, not a CVE patch — but cross-spawn avoids the shell entirely, which is the cleaner property.
- **New runtime dependency** — `cross-spawn@7.0.6` (pinned exactly). Already present transitively via `@google/genai` → `gaxios` → `glob` → `foreground-child`, so no new code in the install tree.

## 0.5.1

- **Smarter pattern extraction** — grep/rg regex patterns are now parsed to extract the longest identifier-like literal instead of blindly stripping all metacharacters. `(Foo|Bar)` correctly extracts `Foo` instead of producing `FooBar`.
- **Quote-aware bash tokenizer** — bash commands are now tokenized with proper quote handling and pipe/`&&`/`;` boundary detection. `grep "validateUser" src/` and `cat file.txt | grep foo` now extract the correct pattern.
- **Cache-after-augment** — patterns are now cached based on results, not before the subprocess runs. Failed or empty augments no longer permanently block retries. A separate `emptyCache` prevents unbounded retries for patterns with no graph data, cleared on session reset.
- **Case-insensitive dedup** — `validateUser` and `ValidateUser` are now recognized as the same pattern, avoiding redundant subprocess spawns.
- **Early-exit on empty content** — skips augmentation when the tool returned no meaningful content (< 10 chars), avoiding wasted subprocess spawns on empty grep results.
- **Cleaner output formatting** — `---` delimiters wrap GitNexus blocks for clearer separation from tool output. Redundant `[GitNexus]` label is omitted when the augment output already includes one.

## 0.5.0

- **Built for gitnexus >= 1.4.8** — aligned all tool schemas and MCP contracts with gitnexus 1.4.8. Adds `gitnexus_rename` and `gitnexus_cypher` tools, updates `detect_changes` to use `scope`/`base_ref`, normalizes parameter names (`maxDepth`, `includeTests`, `file_path`), and adds multi-repo routing with automatic repo root detection.
- **Interactive menu** — `/gitnexus` opens a menu with status display, Analyze, Settings, and Help. Status is shown inline in the menu title. `/gitnexus status` and `/gitnexus analyze` still work as direct shortcuts.
- **Settings panel** — `/gitnexus settings` opens a native TUI settings panel (SettingsList) for auto-augment, timeout, max augments per result, secondary pattern limit, and gitnexus command. All settings persist to `~/.pi/pi-gitnexus.json` and apply immediately.
- **Subcommand autocomplete** — typing `/gitnexus ` now autocompletes subcommands (status, analyze, on, off, settings, query, context, impact, help).
- **Skills** — 5 workflow skills bundled with the extension, available via `/skill:name`:
  - `gitnexus-exploring` — understand architecture, trace execution flows
  - `gitnexus-debugging` — trace bugs, find error sources
  - `gitnexus-pr-review` — review PRs with blast radius analysis
  - `gitnexus-refactoring` — safe rename, extract, split operations
  - `gitnexus-impact-analysis` — pre-change safety analysis
- **Configurable limits** — max augments per result and secondary pattern limit are now settings instead of hardcoded values.

## 0.4.1

- **Settings menu cleanup** — removed duplicate auto-augment toggle. Previously, `/gitnexus settings` showed an auto-augment toggle in the top-level menu *and* inside the Settings panel. The top-level toggle is removed; auto-augment is now configured only in the Settings panel alongside timeout and limit options.
- **`/gitnexus` opens main menu** — running `/gitnexus` with no arguments now opens an interactive menu with **Status** and **Settings** choices instead of printing status directly. `/gitnexus status` still works as a direct shortcut.

## 0.4.0

- **`read_many` augmentation** — batch file reads now trigger per-file labeled graph context. When the agent reads multiple files at once via `read_many`, each code file in the batch (up to 5) is looked up in the knowledge graph and returned as a separate `### filename` section, so the agent always knows which context belongs to which file.

## 0.3.1

- **Package metadata** — added `repository`, `homepage`, and `bugs` fields.

## 0.3.0

- **Configurable command** — the gitnexus binary invocation is now configurable. Default is `gitnexus` on PATH. Use `/gitnexus config` to set a custom command (e.g. `npx gitnexus@latest`) via an input dialog; the value is persisted to `~/.pi/pi-gitnexus.json`. The `--gitnexus-cmd` CLI flag overrides the saved config for one-off runs. Nothing is ever installed automatically.
- **TypeScript compatibility** — `tool_result` handler now uses inferred event types from the API overload instead of a manual annotation, fixing a compile error with `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` 0.54.x.
- **Dependency updates** — `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` to 0.54.2, `@types/node` to 25.x.

## 0.2.0

### Features

- **`read` tool augmentation** — file reads now trigger augmentation. When the agent reads a code file (`.sol`, `.ts`, `.go`, etc.), the filename is used as the lookup pattern to get callers/callees for that file's symbols.
- **Bash `cat`/`head`/`tail` support** — extractPattern now handles `cat file.sol`, `head file.sol`, etc. alongside grep/rg/find.
- **Multi-pattern augmentation** — each tool result now augments up to 3 patterns in parallel: the primary pattern from the tool input, plus filenames extracted from grep output lines (`path/file.sol:line:`). Results are merged into a single `[GitNexus]` block.
- **Session dedup cache** — each symbol/filename is augmented at most once per session, preventing redundant lookups when the agent repeatedly searches for the same thing.

### Fixes

- **Auto-augment now works** — `gitnexus augment` writes its output to stderr, not stdout. `runAugment` was capturing stdout only, so every augmentation returned empty. Fixed by reading from stderr (`stdio: ['ignore', 'ignore', 'pipe']`).
- **Regex patterns cleaned before augment** — grep/rg patterns like `\bwithdraw\s*\(` are stripped of regex metacharacters before passing to `gitnexus augment`, which expects a plain symbol name.
- **`gitnexus_query` limit raised** — max `limit` parameter increased from 20 to 100. The agent was hitting validation errors when requesting more results.
- **Status counters** — `/gitnexus status` now shows searches intercepted and enrichment count for observability.

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

### Features

- **Auto-augment hook** — intercepts grep, find, and bash tool results and appends knowledge graph context (callers, callees, execution flows) via `gitnexus augment`. Mirrors the Claude Code plugin's PreToolUse integration.
- **Five registered tools** — `gitnexus_list_repos`, `gitnexus_query`, `gitnexus_context`, `gitnexus_impact`, `gitnexus_detect_changes` available to the agent with zero setup.
- **stdio MCP client** — tools communicate with `gitnexus mcp` over a stdin/stdout pipe (no network socket, no port). Process is spawned lazily and kept alive for the session.
- **System prompt hint** — when an index is present, appends a one-liner to the agent's system prompt so it understands graph context and knows to use the tools.
- **Session lifecycle** — on session start/switch: resolves full shell PATH (nvm/fnm/volta), probes binary, checks index, notifies status. MCP process restarted on session switch.
- **`/gitnexus` command** with subcommands: `status`, `analyze`, `on`, `off`, `query`, `context`, `impact`, `<pattern>`, `help`.
- **`/gitnexus analyze`** — runs `gitnexus analyze` from within pi with start/completion notifications. Auto-augment is paused for the duration to avoid stale index results.
- **Toggle** — `/gitnexus on` / `/gitnexus off` enables/disables auto-augment without affecting tools. Resets to enabled on session switch.
- **Shell PATH resolution** — spawns `$SHELL -lc 'echo $PATH'` on session start so nvm/fnm/volta-managed binaries are found when pi is launched as a GUI app.
- **Path traversal guard** — `gitnexus_context` file parameter validated to stay within cwd before passing to the MCP server.
- **Graceful failure** — every code path (augment timeout, MCP spawn error, binary missing) returns empty rather than throwing. Extension never breaks the agent's normal flow.
